# Security Policy

The security of our systems and our users' data is a top priority for Zero Logic Solutions. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and our community in helping us keep our platform safe.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues or other public channels.**

Instead, we ask that you report any suspected vulnerabilities privately to our team. This allows us to investigate and address the issue before it becomes public knowledge, protecting our users and their data.

### How to Report

Please send a detailed email to:

**test@gmail.com**

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us investigate and resolve the issue as quickly as possible, please include the following information in your report:

-   **A clear and concise description** of the vulnerability.
-   **The service or application affected** (e.g., our main web app, public API, etc.).
-   **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the vulnerability.
-   **Any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or logs** that demonstrate the issue.
-   **Your contact information**, so we can follow up with you.

## Our Commitment

When you report a vulnerability to us, we commit to the following:

-   We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **3 business days**.
-   We will provide you with a point of contact and keep you updated on our progress as we investigate.
-   We will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.
-   We will publicly credit you for your discovery once the vulnerability is resolved, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Thank you for helping keep Zero Logic Solutions and our apps and users safe.
